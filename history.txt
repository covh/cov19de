27/April/2020 05:23 newest Kreis plot 'Kreis_14524.png', one of 445 items in repo, so first version of generating all the plots (Kreis, BuLa, Germany) was ready.

25/April/2020 22:45 oldest LibreOffice file on my disk 'GermanyValues_RiskLayer-20200425.csv.ods', so 1-2 hours before I must have started looking at the data
15/April/2020 got risklayer's time series data - but more importantly, this text needed attention first. Regardless how much I promoted it (and I did a lot), it never caught on, please explain why if you can. See medium: tiny.cc/pTools maths: tiny.cc/stoch swag: tiny.cc/maskUnity pdf: tiny.cc/pTpdf
