27/April/2020 05:35 file "interactive2.ipynb", went to bed 
27/April/2020 05:23 newest Kreis plot 'Kreis_14524.png', one of 445 items in repo, so first version of generating all the plots (Kreis, BuLa, Germany) was ready.

26/April/2020 23:26 refactoring interactive.ipynb --> interactive.py
26/April/2020 09:52 file on disk "LICENSE" in the new repo 'covh/covviz', then went to bed
26/April/2020 09:38 file on disk "interactive.ipynb", the first version of the jupyter notebook

15/April/2020 got risklayer's time series data - but more importantly, this text needed attention first. Regardless how much I promoted it (and I did a lot), it never caught on, please explain why if you can. See medium: tiny.cc/pTools maths: tiny.cc/stoch swag: tiny.cc/maskUnity pdf: tiny.cc/pTpdf
